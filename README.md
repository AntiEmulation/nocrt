# nocrt
Template C/C++ project that is stripped from C-Runtime Library. This is usually pretty pain in the ass to do everytime especially when using VS, so I decided to write one that is ready to go.
This also aims to minimize executable size.

note that debug info and c++ exceptions are stripped from the exe.
